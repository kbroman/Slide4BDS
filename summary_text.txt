Karl Broman works on genetic mapping in experimental organisms, such
as mice. He is currently focusing on multi-parent crosses, where
multiple mouse strains are crossed for main generations to break up
the chromosomes into small pieces. One can then scan the genome,
similar to a human genome-wide association study, looking for regions
where there is an association between genotype and some clinical
outcome.

He teaches two courses: the literature discussion course for 2nd year
BDS PhD students, and the professional skills course for 3rd year BDS
PhD students.
